### Exercises demonstrating [mcmc-diversitree](https://github.com/dsilvestro/mcmc-diversitree), [PyRate (the BDC model)](https://github.com/dsilvestro/PyRate), and [fossilBM](https://github.com/dsilvestro/fossilBM). 


**mcmc-diversitree** is a Bayesian implementation of the SSE models (state speciation extinction; Maddison et al 2007 Sys Biol) using the R package 'diversitree' (FitzJohn 2009 Sys Biol).

**PyRate** is a Python program implementing various birth-death models applied to fossil occurrence data (and phylogenies) in a Bayesian framework (Silvestro et al. 2018 Nature Comm, 2019 Paleobiology). 

**fossilBM** is an R program implementing models of trait evolution in a Bayesian framework inferred from phylogenies with fossils (Silvestro et al. 2018 Sys Biol; Zhang et al. 2021 Sys Biol).
